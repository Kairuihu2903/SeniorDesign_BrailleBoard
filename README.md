Senior Design for a braille board and application
/n
  Braille is a very important language, yet almost all the tools available for braille users are fairly dated and very expensive. Although in the modern day the necessity of braille seems to be low due to technology such as screen readers, braille displays, and speech recognition software, it is still a valuable language to learn. This is even more apparent in public schools, where the option of even learning Braille is rare if not nonexistent. This project aims to address these challenges by developing an accessible and cost-effective Braille Board coupled with an interactive application tailored for elementary, middle, and high school students. The design approach integrates the ESP32-S3 as the central component facilitating connectivity between the application and the Braille Board, utilizing the PCA9685 16 Channel 12-Bit PWM Servo Motor Driver to enable movement in Braille cells, and employing an HTML-based interface for the application.The prototype successfully demonstrates the functionality of the Braille Board and its seamless interaction with the application, accurately representing inputted letters through Braille cells. The affordability of the created board highlights its potential for widespread use, while the prototype's success indicates avenues for further enhancements. In conclusion, this project presents an effective solution for public schools, offering an accessible Braille learning tool that caters to both visually impaired individuals and those eager to learn Braille, emphasizing the viability and potential for broader implementation in educational environments."
